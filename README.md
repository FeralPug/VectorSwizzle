# VectorSwizzle
Vector Swizzling for C# Unity scripts

Adds HLSL vector swizzling to unity C# scripts through extension methods. Never write new Vector2(Vector3.x, Vector3.z) again, write Vector3.xz();

Just download or copy the script contents into a Unity Script. Include the name space FeralPug_VectorSwizzle in the script you want to swizzle vectors in. Feel free to
rename the name space or just get rid of it if you please.
